# Android Emulator Hypervisor Driver for AMD Processors
Android Emulator Hypervisor Driver for AMD Processors is a hypervisor to
accelerate [Android Emulator][android-studio]. It is made by porting KVM to
Windows (Windows 7 or later, 64bit).

Android Emulator Hypervisor Driver for AMD Processors runs as a Windows driver.
User space support for Android Emulator Hypervisor Driver for AMD Processors is
available from Android Emulator.

## Download and Install
Android Emulator Hypervisor Driver for AMD Processors is released through
[android-studio]. However, only Android Studio with version 4.0 canary 5 or
above can both download and install/update the driver. Otherwise, the Android
Studio will only download the driver package without performing installation.
In the latter case, users are required to install the driver manually.


Prerequisite:
1. CPU has virtualization extension and BIOS has NOT disabled the extension.
2. Hyper-V must be disabled. Please be noted Hyper-V could be enabled silently
by other Windows features, such as Credential Guard. Please consult Microsoft
for detailed information.

Install Instruction:  
  
Use an administrator command console to execute "silent_install.bat" inside
the driver package. Make sure you see the desired output from the installer:
STATE: 4 RUNNING

## Notes
At the time of open source releasing, user space support from [qemu] is NOT
offered. But it should be straight forward if you need to port from Android
Emulator to qemu.

As its name suggests, Android Emulator Hypervisor Driver for AMD Processors is
developed and tested on AMD platform. We only make our best effort in keeping
Intel Processor support.
